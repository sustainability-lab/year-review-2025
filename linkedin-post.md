# LinkedIn Post for Sustainability Lab 2025 Year in Review

**2025 has been a landmark year for the Sustainability Lab at IIT Gandhinagar.**

As we close this chapter, I'm proud to share our journey — a year defined by recognition, growth, and impact.

**Research**
We published 7 papers across top venues: **NeurIPS, AAAI 2026, ACM JCSS, CODS-COMAD, Journal of Building Engineering**, and **Physical Review D**. Our work spans air quality sensing, brick kiln detection, building control, and beyond.

**Recognition**
- **Test of Time Award** for NILMTK — recognizing a decade of impact on energy disaggregation research
- **SIGEnergy Rising Star Award** and **Excellence in Teaching Award**
- Dr. Rishiraj Adhikary earned a **Commendation for Outstanding Research** at his PhD graduation
- Shataxi, Shrimay, and Dhruv brought home prizes in competitions

**Milestones**
- Dr. Rishiraj Adhikary completed his PhD
- Three MTech students graduated: Poornima, Prince, and Shataxi
- We organized the **ACM India Summer School on "AI for Social Good"**

None of this would be possible without our incredible team, collaborators, and the IIT Gandhinagar community.

Here's to building a more sustainable future through AI.
